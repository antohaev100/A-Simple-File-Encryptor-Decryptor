- **Command-Line Interface**: Professional CLI with help system
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain perfect byte-for-byte file integrity
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Work on Windows, Linux, and macOS

### Technical Features

- **Byte-Level Processing**: Operate on raw bytes, not just text characters
- **Key Normalization**: Handle negative and large key values properly
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Memory Management**: Proper allocation and cleanup
- **File I/O**: Binary mode file operations for universal compatibility

### Development Practices

- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, edge cases
- **Documentation**: Professional README, API documentation, contribution guidelines
- **Agile Workflow**: GitHub Issues, feature branches, pull requests
- **Build System**: Modern CMake configuration with multiple build types
- **Code Quality**: Compiler warnings, consistent style, modular design
- **Version Control**: Professional Git practices with meaningful commits

### Supported Operations

```bash
# Encrypt any file type
./FileEncryptor --encrypt input.* encrypted.bin <key>

# Decrypt to restore original
./FileEncryptor --decrypt encrypted.bin output.* <key>

# Display comprehensive help
./FileEncryptor --help
```

## ❌ What This Project DOES NOT Do

### Security Limitations

- **NOT Cryptographically Secure**: Caesar cipher is easily breakable
- **NOT for Production Security**: Do not use for actual sensitive data
- **NO Key Management**: No secure key storage or generation
- **NO Authentication**: No verification of file integrity or authenticity
- **NO Advanced Encryption**: No AES, RSA, or modern encryption algorithms

### Functional Limitations

- **NO File Compression**: Does not reduce file size
- **NO Batch Processing**: Processes one file at a time
- **NO Directory Encryption**: Cannot encrypt entire folders
- **NO Network Operations**: No remote file access or transmission
- **NO GUI Interface**: Command-line only
- **NO Password Protection**: Keys are simple integers, not passwords

### Technical Constraints

- **NO Streaming**: Entire file must fit in available memory
- **NO Progress Indicators**: No progress bars for large files
- **NO Partial Recovery**: Cannot recover from incomplete operations
- **NO File Format Validation**: Does not verify input file formats
- **NO Metadata Preservation**: File timestamps/permissions not maintained

### Platform Limitations

- **NO Mobile Support**: Desktop/server platforms only
- **NO Browser Integration**: No web-based interface
- **NO Cloud Integration**: No direct cloud storage support
- **NO Hardware Acceleration**: No GPU or specialized crypto hardware use

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Possibilities

### Potential Additions (Out of Current Scope)

- **XOR Cipher**: Alternative encryption algorithm
- **Batch Processing**: Encrypt/decrypt multiple files
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for large operations
- **Configuration Files**: Persistent settings and preferences
- **Logging System**: Detailed operation logs
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing and throughput measurements
- **File Integrity Checks**: Checksums and validation
- **Directory Operations**: Recursive folder processing

### Advanced Features (Major Scope Expansion)

- **Modern Encryption**: AES, ChaCha20, or other secure algorithms
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2 or Argon2 for password-based keys
- **Digital Signatures**: File authenticity verification
- **Compressed Encryption**: Built-in compression before encryption
- **Network Operations**: Remote file encryption/decryption
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible algorithm support

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Decisions

### Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Focus on clear, readable code over complex optimizations
2. **Modularity**: Separate encryption, decryption, and CLI components
3. **Testability**: Design for easy unit testing and validation
4. **Portability**: Use standard C11 features for cross-platform compatibility
5. **Documentation**: Prioritize clear documentation and examples

### Implementation Constraints

- **Language**: C11 standard only
- **Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies (CMocka for testing only)
- **File Size**: No arbitrary limits, bounded by available memory
- **Performance**: Optimize for clarity over maximum speed
- **Error Handling**: Fail gracefully with clear error messages

## 🎓 Educational Goals

### Learning Objectives

- **Professional Development Practices**: Agile workflow, testing, documentation
- **C Programming**: Modern C standards, memory management, file I/O
- **Build Systems**: CMake configuration and cross-platform building
- **Testing**: Unit testing frameworks and test-driven development
- **Version Control**: Git workflow, branching strategies, collaboration
- **Documentation**: Technical writing, API documentation, user guides

### NOT Learning Objectives

- **Cryptography**: This is not a cryptography education project
- **Performance Optimization**: Focus is on correctness, not maximum speed
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Caesar cipher is intentionally simple
- **System Programming**: No low-level system interactions
- **Network Programming**: No network communications
